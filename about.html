<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> Hi, I'm Abdul Mateen — a passionate and motivated learner from Rawalpindi, originally from Abbottabad. I have recently completed my FSc, and Iam currently waiting for my final result. While I may be at the beginning of my professional journey, Iam deeply focused on building strong skills in the digital world.


I believe in self-growth through learning and hands-on experience. Previously, I ran a small business on Daraz, where I managed product listings, handled orders, and gained valuable insights into online selling and e-commerce. Although I decided to close the business, it taught me practical lessons about entrepreneurship and customer service.

My goal is to use my skills to create meaningful digital solutions and continue growing in the fields of tech, business, and innovation.

Feel free to connect with me — I'am always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and learning experiences.</p>
